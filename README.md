## HTTP Security Headers Analyzer

This script can be used to verify the presence of HTTP security headers.

Note that it merely checks the presence of these headers but does not make
any judgement on the effectiveness or correctness of the configurations or
rules (e.g., CSP rules, pins of HSTS or X-XSS-Protection set to 0).

This code was used to perform the survey published on Wildfire Labs blog.
